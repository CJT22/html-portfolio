<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all Time.</h2>

<h3>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</h3>
<p>Incredible animation. Really captures the comic book aesthetic.</p>

<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Outstanding concept. Ambiguity is appropriately used.</p>

<h3>Three Idiots</h3>
<p>Great story. Hits just right with its drama and comedy.</p>
